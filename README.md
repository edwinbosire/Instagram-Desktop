# Instagram-Desktop
An instagram clone for the Mac Desktop written in SwiftUI. (This is a UI mock up only)

I did this project to break from the routine of working on my 9-5. It is also the first Mac app i've ever worked on ðŸ¥³

Some things I learnt about swiftUI
* [MatchedGeometryEffect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/matchedgeometryeffect(id:in:properties:anchor:issource:)) This allowed me to do the menu animation on the left hand side.
* [NSVisualEffectView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsvisualeffectview) My first foray into AppKit. I was easier using this as I was already of its iOS counterpart UIVisualEffectView 
* [LazyVGrid](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/lazyvgrid) New iOS 14 API that I have been waiting to use. Turns out to be quite easy to implement.
